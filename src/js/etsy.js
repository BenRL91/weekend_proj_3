If I do not hear back from you after sending a PDF of your print within 24 hrs, I will assume all is correct and ship it to you at that time.

They are printed on thick canvas texture paper (NOT ON ACTUAL CANVAS).  Due to the woven nature of the paper, there are occasionally very tiny color imperfections, or darker specks in the paper. \r\n\r\n\u2022Prints are made using Claria HD Inks. Since they are dye-based inks, please keep the prints away from moisture\/water. For best results, frame as soon as possible and keep the print in the clear sleeve until you are ready for framing. \r\n\r\n\u2022All FLAT prints come on 8.5x11 paper and have a small grey rectangle to help you know where to trim.  I have found that frames vary greatly in size (even when they all say 8x10) so you may need to adjust for your specific frame.  The best frames I have found to use are the shadow box style frames since they really help make the print appear 3-D!\r\n\r\n\u2022**All 3D PRINTS are created on 80lb archival canvas texture paper and bonded with super strength raised glue dots.  3D prints are matted using white beveled mat board and mat backing is gently adhered so your print is ready to frame.

OUT OF STOCK ITEMS:\r\n\r\nWe are currently stocking thousands of items. Most items are in stock as listed, and often we have even more on hand then listed. However, occasionally an item listed may be out of stock. We try our best to avoid this, with so many items and custom orders going out, we may run out of an item. If that occurs, we will email you to right away and give you an update. We can exchange colors, items, hold the item in back order or issue a refund. \r\n\r\n2.

Please convo us!\r\n\r\n3. WE WANT YOU TO BE SAFE: \r\n\r\nPlease note, all items are not intended for children 14 and under. Even though some of our items are natural, we do not advise their use for baby teething or chewing uses.\r\n\r\n4. GET IN TOUCH: \r\n\r\nPlease contact us via email at info@naturebeads.com or give us a call at 386-530-4856. Make sure to inform the date of purchase, your ETSY user ID and name or code of items purchased. This information will help us to get back to you as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n5. VARIATIONS and ONE OF KIND PIECES: \r\n\r\nPlease be aware that natural products can present variation on color, shape and size. Each dye batch will also present a slight variation, so just to make sure you have the same bead color, get as many beads as possible to finish your project. Some of our beads and jewelry are \u201cOne of Kind\u201d and we may not get it again. \r\n\r\n*Organic Leather Straps: keep in mind we are talking about 100% natural hides, from real lovely animals. They have stretch marks, scratches and scars just as we do. Those marks can not be removed from the hides and we actually think they give an extra organic touch and appearance to the pieces. Even though we make several straps from the same hide, they will vary from one to another.\r\n\r\n*Sea Glass beads will present a variation on color, size and shape of beads.\r\n\r\n*Acai Beads are made in house, at our studio in South America and finished here in Florida (dyed and polishing). They will vary in size and sometimes shape. Mostly seeds are round ranging from 8-10mm. They&#39;re 100% natural and the core is similar to wood. They&#39;re very light weight and used often for yoga, praying beads, Malas, all Jewelry, etc.\r\n\r\n*Tagua is made in Brazil & Ecuador. We use the best ECO-AZO free dye in the market. They&#39;re colorfast, light weight and every piece is made by hand.\r\n\r\n6. PIECES MAINTENANCE:\r\n\r\nNatural products require extra care. Please avoid contact with water or sun expose. Wood oil is also welcome for seeds and wood pieces\/beads and make sure you keep your natural jewelry\/beads in a dried place. \r\n\r\n*To keep your Tagua beads with that beautiful shining, you can use a little wax in a cloth and rub the beads carefully.\r\n\r\n7.

I refund any shipping costs paid over the actual shipping cost to ship an order. If preferred, please contact me with the items you are interested in and I can quote shipping and set the order up as a special reserve order.\r\n\r\n--Shipping methods--\r\nPlain favor boxes are shipped with A&#39; Priority NOT registered mail.(unless you choose the shipping upgrade)\r\nAll other items are shipped with A&#39; Priority Registered Mail with tracking number through the Hellenic Post (ELTA ). \r\nThe postman will come to your address to deliver to you. Your signature is needed. If you are not there he will leave a note for you, NOT the package.\r\n\r\n--Shipping times--\r\nNormally , it takes about 10-20 working days for non EU customers to receive their orders and 4-6 days for EU residents. All orders are sent using the address provided in the Etsy order. If otherwise, please let me know and I&#39;ll be happy to send it anywhere in the world you want.\r\n~The delivery time is provided for REFERENCE ONLY and it is based on my own experience sending goods all over the world. Packages can sometimes take longer to be delivered, especially during busy holiday seasons for example. They also can be custom opened, which will add extra time for delivery.\r\nA package usually leaves Greece in 2-3 days, after I put your order in the mailbox. Then it becomes your Country&#39;s Postal Service issue that is beyond my control. With the tracking number I&#39;m sending, you can search for it anytime at your local post office.\r\n\r\nSome countries may charge customs fees. I cannot guarantee this information and buyers are responsible for paying their own customs fees.\r\n","policy_refunds":"DUE TO THE CUSTOM, HANDMADE NATURE OF TOPPERS, ALL ITEMS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.\r\n\r\nI do package things very carefully. However, in the unlikely event that a topper is slightly broken or damaged during shipment, you can easily repair it yourself by using just a dab of water - will act like glue to repair the fondant.  In the case of  bigger damage a small repair kit is included to every order.\r\nIf necessary and there is enough time, I will ship out a replacement topper if the original topper is not repairable. Photo proof is necessary.\r\nPlease note that I do not offer refunds for delays caused by the postal service.\r\nRead carefully the description of the item you are interesting before you buy it.\r\nNote that color may vary a bit from display to display. \r\n\r\nIn addition, I am not responsible for damaged caused as a result of the package being exposed to environmental elements upon delivery. I highly recommend someone is available to receive the package, especially during hot, humid months and periods of rain. Damage can occur to the toppers if the package is left outside unprotected. I recommend  to remove toppers from shipping box immediately upon arrival and place on a flat surface away from heat and humidity to harden up. \r\nAfter that fondant toppers should be placed in an airtight storage container away from direct light, heat and humidity. Do not refrigerate or freeze!\r\n\r\nIf you are not 100% happy with your purchase or service for any reason, please send me a message before leaving your feedback. I pay great attention to customer satisfaction. \r\n","policy_additional":"Product Information:\r\n- Additional info about Covapaste fondant can be found here http:\/\/www.cakedecoratingsupplies.co.uk\/covapaste-icing-white-5kg.html\r\n\r\nEach item is Made-To-Order, so please allow slight artistic changes from the picture shown.\r\nHints & Tips:\r\n** The moisture from the frosting tends to really soften the fondant toppers so I recommend applying the toppers immediately prior to your event. It is very rare but, in extreme humidity, the colors on the toppers can bleed if they are applied to the frosting too early. \r\n**I recommend applying to soft frosting but, if your frosting has hardened, use a small dab of water on the back of the topper to attach it to the frosting. \r\n\r\nCUSTOM ORDERS-- I&#39;d love to create something especially for you.

I strive to have a lightening fast turn around because I know you want your stuff yesterday!  \r\n\r\nCANADIAN SHIPPING:  Shipping outside of the US has skyrocketed in the past few months.  Even a 4oz package to Canada now costs over $8.  So if you are truly interested in having something shipped outside the country, please convo me with the size\/quantity of cards or stickers that you are wanting and I&#39;ll get you a shipping quote. TIP:  buying in bulk is the best way to get the most from your shipping money.\r\n\r\nSome Canadian customers may not see much of a change in shipping charges on cards if you live in or near Ontario.","policy_refunds":"If you are unhappy with your purchase, please contact me via email or Etsy to let me know before leaving feedback so I have the opportunity to make it right for you if it is within my power.  \r\n\r\nPRODUCT DEFECTS:  It doesn&#39;t happen often, but on the rare occasion when cards are defective due to some error in the printing process, I will need a couple of hard copies to show the print company in order to request a reprint.  Please be prepared to snail mail a couple of them to me.\r\n\r\nTYPOS:  I make every effort to ensure that your product is print-ready and free of mistakes before placing your order with the printer.  *****If you have approved a proof that contains mistakes, I will not be held liable for reprinting or refunding your order.  Please be sure to examine proofs closely before giving your final approval.\r\n\r\nCOLOR ISSUES:  Sometimes there are slight variations in color due to the print process.  Also, due to monitor settings, what you see on your screen may or may not be an accurate representation of the true color.  The print company will NOT refund for color issues so I cannot offer that option to you.  In some rare cases a reprint may be allowed at a reduced price.\r\n\r\n","policy_additional":"CUSTOM ORDERS need to fall into one of the following categories:  \r\n\r\n1.  You have an existing logo you&#39;d like to use within one of my designs.  I am happy to use your logo in one of my designs if you have a print ready version (300 dpi high resolution jpg - or better yet, a png, psd, pdf or ai file).  NOTE:  I cannot use &quot;for web use&quot; images as they will not be of a high enough resolution for print.\r\n\r\n2.  You like one of my designs but would like to change a few of the elements within that design (ie. color, pattern, etc)\r\n\r\n3.  You have an existing design you would like me to get printed up for you.  NOTE:  usually other designers do not allow for the amount of &quot;bleed&quot; that my print partner requires, so the best thing is to contact me for a card template to send your designer.  Sometimes I am able to modify a design to fit the requirements, other times you will need your designer to play around with it.\r\n\r\nI do not do custom logo designs and usually I do not like to create a custom card design from scratch.  That is a whole other business.  I do have a short list of designers that I can refer you to.\r\n\r\nCost for custom orders varies and depends on how much time I would have to spend on your files to get them print ready.  If your logo has to be trimmed up and modified in order to fit one of my designs, or if I have to modify my design to fit your logo, the minimum charge would be $25.\r\n\r\nHowever, if your design is perfectly print ready, there will be no additional fee.\r\n\r\nJust contact me with any questions.  :)\r\n","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1408478326,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":"(automated reply)\r\n\r\nThe shop is closed until at least December 27th.
